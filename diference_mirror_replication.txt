Mirroring :-    

1)The Mirroring is database Level.


2) The Mirror database is not accessible for read or write access.

3)Information flow will be only one way (from Principal to Mirror Server)

4) In case of failure of the Principal Database, the Mirror Database will take over the control and will act as

Principal and applications can be redirected automatically to connect to this new Principal Server. Very little downtime. No

code change required in the application.

5)In Short, Mirroring is a good tool for DR (Disaster Recovery) with very little downtime, but the drawback is that the DR site will not be accessible to users.

6) The mirroring supports  automatic fail over.

 

Replication:-

1)Relication is object level and two way update data
  
2)The Subscriber Database (backup site) is open to reads and writes.

3)Changes can be merged, bi-directional changes can be made, so the information can flow from Publisher to

Subscriber and the other way around..

4) In case of failure on Publisher, applications need to be re-directed to the Subscriber manually (in case you

really want to do that), requires code change in the app or the connection string.


5)whereas Replication can be used to Merge Data between two Servers, can act as a good tool

for Reporting purposes as the backup site is accessible to the users, can also act a DR solution.

6) Replication doesn't support Automatic failover.

 


It all depends on what you need, what are the business requirements , which will help you to choose the right topology in

your environment.
